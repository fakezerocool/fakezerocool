Hi there, Zerocool, for those who are old enough to remember, is a character from an old old movie called "Hackers". Well, I ain't the real one for sure and hence the moniker FakeZeroCool. Here's some stuff about me. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on writing Apps Scripts for Google Sheets
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Github
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything new about Microbit (to help my kids)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... nothing yet cause I don't know what I don't know. 
- 💬 Ask me about running not coding. 
- 📫 How to reach me: You'll figure it out
- ⚡ Fun fact: I run alot and I'm old.
