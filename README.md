- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything new about Microbit (to help my kids)
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... nothing yet cause I don't know what I don't know. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about running not coding. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: You'll figure it out
- âš¡ Fun fact: I run alot and I'm old.
